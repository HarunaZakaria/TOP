    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an egg stew recipe for anyone trying to cook an egg stew</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 eggs</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 large onion, sliced thin</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to
        cover by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil;
        remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15
        minutes; drain. Run cold water over the eggs to cool completely; peel.
        Cut 4 slits into each of the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and peppercorns in a small skillet
        over medium heat until very fragrant; grind into powder. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet or kadhai over medium heat. Stir the
        turmeric into the oil. Quickly fry the eggs in the hot oil on all sides,
        about 2 minutes. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the onions in the hot oil until golden brown; add the ginger,
        garlic, and tomatoes and continue cooking until the tomatoes are soft.
        Stir the ground seed mixture, ground red pepper, and ground coriander
        into the onion mixture and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the water
        into the skillet. Add the coconut, jaggery, tamarind, and salt; return
        to a boil and cook until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Reduce
        heat to medium-low; add the eggs and allow to simmer another 10 minutes.
        If the gravy is too thick, thin out with a little water. Garnish with
        the cilantro leaves to serve.
      </li>
    </ul>
